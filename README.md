# A-Star-Algorithm-Visualized
A visualization of how the A* algorithm traverses a 50x50 grid to find the shortest path between any two points on the grid. Choose the start and end points, set up blockades, and then trigger the algorithm to find the shortest path to your destination. An advanced algorithm that finds application in several real-world scenarios as in navigation systems on cars, logistics networks, etc.

## Usage
Click anywhere on the grid to set the start point. Then set an end point by clicking elsewhere on the grid. Next, set up blockades by clicking and dragging the mouse across the screen. Press the spacebar key to initiate the algorithm and visualization process. After complection press the C key to clear the grid and start over.
